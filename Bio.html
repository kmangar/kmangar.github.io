                    <h1>Kham Mangar</h1>
                    <p>My parents were Bhutnese Refugees living in Nepal. 
                        I was born in the refugee camp called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldhap_refugee_camp">goldhap.</a>
                        I lived there for 9 years. The school and the houses were made out of clay and roof made of wood, bamboo and thatch.
                        These houses would easily catch on fire and spread rapidly because the houses were really close to each other.
                        In 2008 our whole camp burned to <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/4d88c4a76.html">ashes </a>
                        and we were immigrant left homless. However with the help of UNHCR and its partners, including Caritas, Lutheran World Federation, 
                        the Association of Medical Doctors of Asia, the World Food Programme and the Red Cross. We were given food and shelter. 
                        We lived in the nerby forest camping in the tents for couple of months, until IOM (International Organization for Migration)
                        came and gave us a opportunity to resettle in the United States.
